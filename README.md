Riemann-Sums
============

Will continue to tweak this, but the project can already serve as an accurate demonstration of how to calculate left, right, mid-point and trapezoidal Riemann sums.

Project utilizes Dave Delong's DDMathParser, which can be found here: https://github.com/davedelong/DDMathParser

It has been written along side another Reimann-Sum Caclulator written in C# by [@yumaikas](https://github.com/yumaikas) [yumaikas/ReimannSums](https://github.com/yumaikas/ReimannSums).
